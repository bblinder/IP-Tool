Pinger is a command-line script that provides a JSON overview of an IP address' geolocation and ISP information, as well as performing a ping check. It's intended to be a single-step process for determining if a provided IP address can be used to provision an Akamai publishing point.

The geolocation/ISP info is polled via the ipinfo.io API.
